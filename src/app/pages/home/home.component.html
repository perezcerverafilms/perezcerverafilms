  <p class="description">
    Laura Pérez Cervera is a <span class="underlined">screenwriter and filmmaker</span> who tells bold, heartfelt stories with soul and a little bit of sparkle.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    She’s the writer-director behind <em>Bendita Rebeldía</em>, a feature film praised for its strong female lead and emotional bite, and was part of the Creative Direction team behind Disney’s <span class="underlined">Oscar-winning <em>Encanto</em></span>—yes, that magical family.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Whether it’s grounded drama, a dash of <span class="underlined">magical realism</span>, or something totally offbeat, Laura brings <span class="underlined">sharp storytelling</span>, big heart, and <span class="underlined">vibrant visuals</span> to everything she does. Her work spans drama, comedy, and the fantastical, always grounded in deep empathy and a strong sense of place.
